						<h1 class="title_home">The consequences of climate change</h1>
						<p class="date_time">October 17, 2019</p>					
						<ul>
							
							<li class="list">Loss of biodiversity
								<ul>
									<li class="list_item">Earth's temperature is currently causing the species to disappear or be in danger of extinction.
							About 50% of plants and animals will face extinction by 2050 if the earth's temperature rises by 1.1 to 6.4 degrees Celsius.
							This loss is due to loss of habitat due to fallow land, deforestation and warming of the sea.
							Biologists have found that some animals have migrated to the polar regions to find suitable temperature habitats.
							For example, the red fox, which used to live in North America, has now moved to the Arctic.
									</li>
									<li class="list_item">People are not out of influence. Deserted land and rising sea levels also threaten our habitat.
							the loss of plants and animals also means our food, fuel and income are lost.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							
							<li class="list">War and conflict
							
								<ul>
									<li class="list_item">Food and fresh water are increasingly scarce. The land gradually disappeared but the population continued to increase. 
							These are elements of conflict and war between countries and territories.
									</li>
									<li class="list_item">Due to the warmer global temperatures and negative climate change, the natural resources have been exhausted. A typical conflict because of climate change is in Darfur. Conflict broke out during a prolonged drought.
							During the 20 years this region only had a small amount of rain and even years without rain, the temperature therefore increased.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="list">Economic impacts
								<ul>
									<li class="list_item">The economic losses caused by climate change are also increasing with the earth's temperature. Heavy storms caused crop failures, costing billions of dollars. In addition, to control the disease spread after each flood,
							a huge amount of money is needed. The more severe the climate, the more the economy deficits.
									</li>
									<li class="list_item">Economic losses affect every aspect of life. People suffer from rising food and fuel prices. Governments face significant declines in profits from tourism and industry, people's need for food and clean water after a typhoon,
							and the huge cost of cleaning up rubble afterward. floods, and border tensions.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							
							
							<li  class="list">Drought
								<ul>
									<li class="list_item">While some parts of the world are inundated with constant flooding, others have experienced prolonged droughts. Drought depletes domestic water sources and irrigation, seriously affecting the agriculture of many countries. As a result, food production and supplies are threatened,
									a large part of the world's population is and will suffer hunger.</li>
									
									<li class="list_item">Currently, regions such as India, Pakistan, and Africa are experiencing droughts, rainfall in these areas is getting lower and lower, and this situation will continue to continue for the next few decades. According to estimates, by 2020, there will be about 75 million to 250 million Africans lacking water for living and farming,
									leading to the continent's agricultural production will be reduced by about 50%.</li>
								</ul>
								<img class="item" src="img/6.jpg" title="" alt="">
								<cite class="img">Drought image in the field</cite>
							</li>
							<li class="list">Storm and flood
								<ul>
									<li class="list_item">Warming temperatures in oceans are a factor in the strength of storms.
									The fierce storm is increasingly more. In just the past 30 years, the number of powerful thunderstorms has nearly doubled.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<img class="item" src="img/1.jpg" title="" alt="">
								<cite class="img">Flood images affect the lives of people</cite>
							<li class="list">The heat wave intense
								<ul>
									<li class="list_item">Climate change has created record heatwaves and high temperatures locally as well as at national, regional and global levels. 
									Heat wave phenomena start earlier, end later, occur more frequently and become more severe as a result of climate change.</li>
									<li class="list_item">The consequences of these heat waves are the risk of forest fires, diseases caused by high temperatures, and of course contribute to the increase in the average temperature of the earth. Earth's temperature may rise from 3 째C to 5 째C by the end of this century. This is far beyond the goal of the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
									trying to keep the average global temperature rise below 2 째 C, or better yet, as close as 1,5 째C.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<img  class="item" src="img/8.jpg" title="" alt="">
							<cite class="img"> Prolonged high temperatures cause forest fires</cite>
							<li class="list">Glaciers are shrinking
								<ul>
									<li class="list_item">Glaciers are shrinking. The vast tundra once covered with a thick layer of permanent ice is now covered by trees. For example, 
									the glaciers in the Himalayas that provide fresh water to the Ganges River - the source of drinking and farming for about 500 million people - are shrinking by about 37m per year.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li class="list">
								<ul>
									<li class="list_item">Increasing temperatures on earth make the sea level rise. Increasing temperatures cause glaciers on
									Earth to melt and increase the amount of water flowing into the oceans.</li>
								</ul>
